Let's play riot 4+, FOR FUN.

## This project uses
* HTML, Js, CSS
* [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
* [Riot](https://riot.js.org/)
* [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)
* [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/)

## Additional features
* Support multiple components declaration in one single file. And the last one will be default exported.
* Support Store/Context by mixin implementation.
* Support Server side rendering (SSR).
* Support using import from npm packages, and bundle libraries by each page.

## It is JUST for fun.
I try to have a HTTP server solution for my only need, so there is no much wise choice or best practice.  
Everything recalls a simple concept - easy using and fun for developer.
