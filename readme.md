====
Let's play riot 4, FOR FUN.

## This project uses
* HTML, Js, CSS
* [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
* [Riot](https://riot.js.org/)
* [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)

## Additional features
* developer can write sub components before default exported component in one single file.
* support Store/Context by mixin implementation.
* support Server side rendering (SSR).

## It is JUST for fun.
I try to have a HTTP server solution for my only need, so there is no much wise choice or best practice.  
Everything recalls a simple concept - easy using and fun for developer.
